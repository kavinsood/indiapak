### Code Quality Standards

1. **Code Philosophy**:
   - Write the absolute minimum code required. Prioritize simplicity and optimization.
   - Fix actual issues directly - no fallback implementations for bugs.
   - Make no changes outside current task scope. Never break existing functionality.

2. **Code Structure & Organization**:
   - Maintain well-organized project structure. Actively avoid redundancy.
   - Use lowercase kebab-case for directories (`utils/data-fetchers`).
   - Split long files (>300 lines) or functions (>50 lines) into modular units.
   - File structure: exports → components/definitions → helpers → static data → types.

3. **Code Standards**:
   - Format with Prettier (80-char width). Treat ESLint warnings as errors.
   - Prefer named exports: `export { MyFunction }`.
   - Use descriptive names. Booleans: `isAuthenticated`, `hasSubscription`.
   - Prefer functional programming. Avoid classes unless essential for library patterns.
   - Use early returns to reduce nesting: `if (!user) return;`.

### Error Handling & Security

4. **Error Management**:
   - Never swallow exceptions without proper handling.
   - Use `try-catch` for all async operations. Define custom error types for clarity.
   - Log server errors, display user-friendly client messages.

5. **Security Basics**:
   - Load API keys/secrets from environment variables only.
   - Never hardcode secrets in source code.
   - Do NOT edit/delete database data without explicit permission.

### Git Standards

6. **Commit Quality**:
   - Use Conventional Commits: `feat: add login endpoint`.
   - Commit only when tests pass and functionality is self-contained.
   - Use `git rm <file>` for tracked file deletion.

Note: use pnpm instead of npm, don't create a new dev server, assume one is already running.

*Note: TaskMaster handles comprehensive workflow, task management, and project setup. These rules focus on code quality and standards.*
